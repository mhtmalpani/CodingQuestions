### [Array Element Multiplication](https://github.com/mhtmalpani/CodingQuestions/blob/master/src/ArrayElementMultiplication.kt)

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6]

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?


### [Decoding Ways](https://github.com/mhtmalpani/CodingQuestions/blob/master/src/DecodingWays.kt)

Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.

You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.
